## Installation

1. Install Minecraft 1.16 or later
2. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/)
3. Download OneBar, [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api), [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu), [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config)
4. Place the JARs you downloaded to your Minecraft's mods folder
5. Run the game!

Currently also works on [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org), though no effort has yet been made to explicitly support it. See [#21](https://github.com/Madis0/OneBar/issues/21).

## How it works

OneBar is meant to be contextual, showing the values and bars only when you need them. Tips:

* The positive effects, including health itself, are displayed left-to-right; negative effects are displayed right-to-left. 
* If you get hungry, the hunger overlay is displayed over the health by its value. 
  * If you eat, you'll lose the overlay and the value, because you no longer need it. 
  * If you are also underwater, the water bar is displayed on top of health _and_ hunger because it is the most important value in this case. 
* Health is _always_ the first number and hunger is _almost always_¬†the last number¬†(except when you have the hunger effect).
  * Everything in between is an estimate, additional health or damage source (can be disabled).
* Remember [old Minecraft without hunger and experience](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Beta_1.7.png)? This mod gives you a visually similar experience without losing modern functionality.
 
The mod only uses client-side data, so it is never needed on a server. There are also a lot of settings for configuring the colors and visibility of various elements.

### Bars and values

* **1** represents any number. 
* All emoji are white and look a bit different in-game. Text is shown when emoji are disabled (recommended for unicode or custom fonts).
* Estimates are a best guess based on what the client knows at the time, can change by server-side changes or natural occurences, displayed _in italic_. Can be disabled in options.

## Mods I recommend with OneBar

* [BerdinskiyBear's Armor HUD](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/berdinskiybears-armor-hud) - adds a customizable hotbar-like armor bar
* [Food Highlight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/food-highlight) - shows orange (wasted) and green (exact/less) indicators on food in hotbar and inventories
* [Enhanced Attack Indicator](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enhanced-attack-indicator) - adds more features to the attack cooldown, e.g drawing a bow
* [Till it Breaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/till-it-breaks) - adds numeric durability and arrow count (for bows and crossbows) to hotbar items

## FAQ

**Q: Why do I have to download [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) separately?**

A: Because it's big, gets updated a lot and you probably have a mod or two that requires it anyway. If one of your mods already bundles it, you don't have to download it at all :)

**Q: How do I edit the colors?**

A: Click `Esc` ‚Üí `Mods` ‚Üí `OneBar` ‚Üí `config button`. Colors are formatted as opacity + RGB in HEX, so choose an opacity from [this list](https://gist.github.com/lopspower/03fb1cc0ac9f32ef38f4#all-hex-value-from-100-to-0-alpha) and use [any HEX color picker](https://rgbacolorpicker.com/hex-color-picker) for choosing a color. For example if I want 80% opacity (`CC`) on blue (`0000FF`), I will enter `#CC0000FF`.

**Q: Can I use this with minigames?**

A: Yes! There are options to disable hunger display or enable UHC mode, plus you can toggle those or entire OneBar with a keybind (if you set one).

**Q: Can I use this in my favorite server?**

A: Yes. If things like AppleSkin and effect HUDs are allowed, you can use the full featureset of OneBar. If they are not, just disable effect estimates to use it for essentially only health and hunger.

**Q: Forge support?**

A: No. Feel free to fork according to the license or [check out my resource pack that inspired this](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/material-design-hud).

**Q: Backports?**

A: No. There are old versions available down to 1.16.5 though.

**Q: Snapshots?**

A: Maybe. If I have time, I might do targeted updates, but otherwise as long as you have the latest Cloth Config and Fabric API, it probably runs anyway.
